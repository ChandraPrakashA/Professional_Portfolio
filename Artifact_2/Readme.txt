Artifact_2 contains the work I have done during my 3rd week of AI/Ml course and application of the knowledge using ML algorithmn(Logistic regression) for Email spam detection.

Title : Email Spam Detection using Logistic Regression
Goal/Objectives:
Classifying the incoming emails as spam or not spam.

Value Proposition :
 (Small Dataset):
 A lightweight spam detection model ideal for the quick demonstrations, showcasing how the machine learning can classify emails even with the minimal data.
 (Large Dataset):
 A robust, high accuracy spam detection system trained on realistic and balanced data, offering scalable and reliable performance for the real world email filtering solutions.

Tools/Resourses:
Jupyter Notebook
Python Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
UCI Dataset

The following report 
Machine Learning vs Deep learning

Title : ML vs DL report differentiates between machine learning and deep learning by analyzing a real-world case study
Goal/Objectives:
This report compares ML example (email spam detection) and DL example (image recognition), explaining why each approach is suitable for its respective problem and why the alternative approach is not as effective.

Value Proposition :
Both ML and DL have their own strengths, depending on the nature of the problem. ML is efficient and effective for structured data tasks, like spam detection, where predefined features guide the classification. DL on the other hand, excels in the complex tasks like image recognition, where automatic feature extraction is crucial. Choosing the right approach ensures accuracy, efficiency and scalability in real-world applications.
