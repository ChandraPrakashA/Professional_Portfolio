Artifact_3 contains the work I have done during my 4th week of AI/Ml course and application of the knowledge using ML algorithmn(SVM) for Parkinson's disease detection

Title : Parkinson's Disease Detection using SVM algorithmn
Objectives:
To predict whether a person has Parkinson's disease using biomedical voice data. SVM does a best job in classification as it gives good accuracy on voice features and works well on high dimensional data.

Value proposition:
A practical machine learning solution for early detection of Parkinson's disease.
Provides both the doctors and researchers with a voice-based diagnostic assistant.
Model can be extended with larger, more balanced datasets and clinical features.

Tools/Resourses:
Jupyter Notebook
Python Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
UCI Parkinson’s Dataset

Title : Adapting to Challenges
Objectives:
Identify biblical examples of adaptive leadership.
Apply biblical thinking to personal situations.

Value proposition:
a.Consider a challenge you are currently facing in your leadership role. How can you seek God’s wisdom and adapt your approach to overcome this challenge?
b.Reflect on a moment when you need to take a significant risk or make a tough decision. How can Esther’s story encourage you to approach your challenge with courage and strategic thinking?
Tools/Resourses:
The Holy Bible, New International Version (2011)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title : Communicating for Learning
Objectives:
Articulate the factors that contribute to successful change leadership, specifically in the context of AI/ML integration.
Discuss communication in change management and leadership.

Value proposition:
Albert Einstein is credited with saying that if you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it well enough. So, for this task, your challenge is to create the best simple explanation you can about neural networks in machine learning.
Tools Used:
Used Gen AI tool for Structure and Clarity purpose

Reflection :

Why did you choose this artifact? 
I chose this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to apply machine learning algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), to a real-world problem like Parkinson's disease detection. The ability to predict Parkinson’s from voice data is a practical application of AI/ML that holds potential for improving healthcare outcomes. Additionally, it showcases my understanding of SVM’s strength in high-dimensional classification tasks.

What does it demonstrate about your AI/ML skills? 
This project demonstrates my skills in applying SVM to a biomedical dataset, focusing on preprocessing, feature selection, model training and evaluation. It also highlights my ability to work with complex datasets, where the model's performance depends on how well I handle the data and choose the right features. The application of SVM to a healthcare problem like Parkinson's disease detection also shows my ability to align AI/ML techniques with domain-specific needs, such as medical diagnostics.

How does it align with your career goals? 
This artifact aligns with my career goals of working at the intersection of AI and healthcare. The project’s focus on early disease detection with machine learning is a significant part of my career interest in using AI to solve real-world problems. By mastering the techniques like SVM for healthcare applications, I am better prepared to pursue advanced roles in AI applications that improve quality of life and support medical decision-making.

What did you learn from creating it? 
I learned the importance of selecting the right features when working with high-dimensional data, as well as how SVM can be a powerful tool for classification tasks like disease detection. Additionally, I developed a deeper understanding of the challenges in applying machine learning to medical datasets and how effective preprocessing can improve model performance. This project also taught me how to communicate complex AI/ML concepts clearly, as I applied the lessons on change leadership and communication in AI/ML integration to simplify the explanation of these concepts.
