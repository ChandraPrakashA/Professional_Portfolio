Artifact_3 contains the work I have done during my 4th week of AI/Ml course and application of the knowledge using ML algorithmn(SVM) for Parkinson's disease detection

Title : Parkinson's Disease Detection using SVM algorithmn
Objectives:
To predict whether a person has Parkinson's disease using biomedical voice data. SVM does a best job in classification as it gives good accuracy on voice features and works well on high dimensional data.

Value proposition:
A practical machine learning solution for early detection of Parkinson's disease.
Provides both the doctors and researchers with a voice-based diagnostic assistant.
Model can be extended with larger, more balanced datasets and clinical features.

Tools/Resourses:
Jupyter Notebook
Python Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
UCI Parkinson’s Dataset

Title : Adapting to Challenges
Objectives:
Identify biblical examples of adaptive leadership.
Apply biblical thinking to personal situations.

Value proposition:
a.Consider a challenge you are currently facing in your leadership role. How can you seek God’s wisdom and adapt your approach to overcome this challenge?
b.Reflect on a moment when you need to take a significant risk or make a tough decision. How can Esther’s story encourage you to approach your challenge with courage and strategic thinking?
Tools/Resourses:
The Holy Bible, New International Version (2011)

Title : Communicating for Learning
Objectives:
Articulate the factors that contribute to successful change leadership, specifically in the context of AI/ML integration.
Discuss communication in change management and leadership.

Value proposition:
Albert Einstein is credited with saying that if you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it well enough. So, for this task, your challenge is to create the best simple explanation you can about neural networks in machine learning.
Tools Used:
Used Gen AI tool for Structure and Clarity purpose
