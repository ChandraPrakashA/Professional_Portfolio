Artifact_4 contains the work I have done during my 5th week of AI/Ml course and application of the knowledge using KMeans for Customer Segmentation.

Title : Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Objectives:
To cluster customers into the groups based on Age, Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100) using the K-Means Clustering.

Value proposition:
This project highlights how unsupervised learning, specifically K-Means Clustering can be used in marketing to uncover hidden customer segments. These insights empower businesses to personalize promotions, optimize campaign targeting and allocate resources more effectively.

Reflection:
Why did you choose this artifact? 
I chose this artifact because it demonstrates the power of unsupervised learning in real-world business applications. Using the K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on demographic and spending data helps uncover hidden patterns, which can be invaluable for the targeted marketing strategies. This project aligns with my interest in applying AI/ML to practical problems, particularly in the business and marketing sectors.

What does it demonstrate about your AI/ML skills? 
This project showcases my ability to apply unsupervised learning techniques like K-Means Clustering to solve a practical problem. It also demonstrates my proficiency in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and feature selection, all of which are crucial for working with real-world datasets. Additionally, the use of visualization tools like Matplotlib and Plotly highlights my ability to communicate insights effectively through data visualization.

How does it align with your career goals? 
This project aligns with my career goals of working in AI and data science, particularly in industries where the customer behavior and personalization are key. Understanding how to segment customers effectively is essential in the marketing and business strategy and the skills gained here are directly applicable to roles that involve business intelligence and customer analytics.

What did you learn from creating it? 
I learned how important it is to choose the right features and properly scale data when applying clustering algorithms like K-Means. The project also taught me how to interpret and visualize clustering results to derive actionable business insights. I improved my understanding of how unsupervised learning can be used to uncover valuable patterns in data without labeled outcomes, which is crucial for many real-world applications.
